                </h2>
                <p>
                    Getting rid of an old car can be a complex and emotional process. But sometimes it’s necessary to make room for a new one. And when that time comes, Kevs Cash for Junk Cars is here to help.

                </p>
                <p>
                    Here are a few tips to prepare your car for sale to Kevs Cash for Junk Cars:
                </p>
                <br>
                <ol style="padding-left: 50px">
                    <li>
                        Make sure the car is clean. This may seem like a no-brainer, but it’s essential to make sure the car is as clean as possible before selling it. A clean car will fetch a higher price than a dirty one.
                    </li>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <li>
                        Remove all personal belongings from the car. This includes things like clothes, toys, and electronics. You don’t want to leave anything behind that could be considered personal property.
                    </li>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <li>
                        Make sure the car is in good working condition. If the car is not running correctly,      it will likely fetch a lower price. Make sure to get the car serviced and repaired before selling it.
                    </li>
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    <li>
                        Gather all pertinent paperwork. This includes the car’s title, registration, and insurance information. Having all this paperwork in order will make the selling process much smoother.
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <br>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Following these tips will help you get the most money for your old car when you sell it to Kevs Cash for Junk Cars.
